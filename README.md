## Dataset

The Kannada MNIST dataset is a collection of labeled images representing Kannada digits. Each image is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels. The dataset is an extension of the classic MNIST dataset but features Kannada digits instead of Hindu numerals.

You can download the dataset from [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/higgstachyon/kannada-mnist).

## Dataset

The Toxic Tweets dataset comprises labeled tweets, categorized as either toxic (1) or non-toxic (0). This dataset is designed for training machine learning models to predict the toxicity level of tweets.
